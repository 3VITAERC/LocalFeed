## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Server

**For development (simple):**
```bash
python server.py
```

**Change the port (if 7123 is in use):**
```bash
# Using command line argument
python server.py --port 9000

# Or using environment variable
PORT=9000 python server.py
```

**Recommended for production:**

*macOS/Linux:*
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:7123 server:app
```

*Windows:*
```bash
waitress-serve --port=7123 server:app
```

You'll see output like:
```
==================================================
  LocalFeed
  TikTok-style image viewer
==================================================

  Access on this machine:    http://localhost:7123
  Access remotely:    http://192.168.1.xxx:7123

  For better performance with many images, use gunicorn:
    gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:7123 server:app

  Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
==================================================
```

> **Note:** Configuration files (`config.json`, `favorites.json`, `trash.json`) are created automatically on first launch and are gitignored.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

For desktop users, the following keyboard shortcuts are available:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **H** or **Left Arrow** | Mark for deletion (toggle) |
| **J** or **Down Arrow** | Scroll down one image |
| **K** or **Up Arrow** | Scroll up one image |

| **Escape** | Close any open modal |

Press **?** at any time to see the keyboard shortcuts popup.

## Folder Browser

Tap the **Folders** button at the top of the screen to quickly jump between your photo folders.

**How it works:**
- The folder list is **automatically populated** from your indexed directories
- It shows all **leaf folders** (folders that actually contain images), not just the root folders you added in settings
- For example, if you added `/Users/name/Pictures` in settings, you'll see individual folders like `Summer 2024`, `Family/July`, `Vacation` etc.
- Each folder shows its image count
- Use the **search box** to quickly filter folders by name or path
- Tap any folder to filter your view to just that folder's images
- The currently active folder is highlighted in gold

This makes it easy to navigate large photo libraries without manually digging through folder structures!

## Display Options

In Settings, you can toggle:

- **Shuffle Photos** - When enabled, photos are randomized each time you load the page. Perfect for discovering forgotten photos! Each page refresh gives you a new random order.

## Supported Image & Video Formats

- **Images:** JPG / JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, HEIC
- **Videos:** m4v (under 75mb)

### Video Loading

Videos are optimized for smooth scrolling with several techniques:

- **First-frame rendering:** The next video in queue (+1 slide) pre-renders its first frame, eliminating black flash when scrolling
- **Audio preloading:** Audio for the next video is pre-buffered, ensuring instant sound when you scroll
- **Poster frames:** When enabled, videos show a blurred preview first, then crossfade to the playing video
- **HTTP Range requests:** Videos stream efficiently — only ~1-2MB is buffered ahead, saving bandwidth

## Cross-Platform Support

LocalFeed works on both **macOS** and **Windows**. The application handles platform-specific path separators automatically:

- **macOS/Linux:** Uses forward slashes (`/Users/name/Pictures`)
- **Windows:** Uses backslashes (`C:\Users\name\Pictures`)

Path normalization is handled internally, so you can use either format when entering folder paths in the web interface.

## Performance Features

- **HTTP Caching** - Images are cached for 7 days with ETag support. Scrolling back doesn't re-download.
- **304 Responses** - Modified images only are re-fetched when they change
- **Image List Caching** - Folder scans are cached for 30 seconds to reduce disk I/O
- **Production Server** - Use gunicorn (macOS/Linux) or waitress (Windows) for concurrent request handling

### Performance Cache (Optional)

For even faster loading, enable optional cache optimizations in **Settings → Performance Cache**:

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Image Thumbnails** | Resizes images to 1920px max, converts to WebP | 50-80% smaller files |
| **Video Posters** | Extracts first frame as preview image | Instant preview while video loads |

> **Requires ffmpeg** - Install separately:
> - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
> - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
> - Windows: Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

The `.thumbnails/` cache folder is automatically created when needed and stored in your project directory (gitignored).

Tested on photo libraries up to 10,000.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access from Phone?
- Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi network
- Check if your computer's firewall is blocking port 7123
- Try the IP address shown when starting the server

### Images not loading?
- Make sure the folder path is correct
- Check that images are in supported formats
- Look at the server console for error messages

### GIFs loading slowly?
- GIFs are large files. Once loaded, they're cached for 7 days
- Use gunicorn for better concurrent handling
- Consider the first load as "warming up" the cache

### HEIC images not showing?
- HEIC is supported but may not display in all browsers (try safari)
- For best compatibility, convert HEIC to JPG first

### Windows: `ModuleNotFoundError` or import conflicts?

If you see errors like `No module named 'app'` or conflicts with other Python packages (ComfyUI, etc.), your system Python path may be polluted by other applications.

**Solution: Create an isolated virtual environment**

```powershell
# Use 'py' launcher instead of 'python' to avoid embedded Python issues
py -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies fresh
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
waitress-serve --port=7123 server:app
```

> **Note:** Run `.\venv\Scripts\activate` each time you open a new terminal. You'll see `(venv)` in your prompt when active.

**Why this happens:** Some applications (like ComfyUI portable) add their embedded Python to your system PATH, which can cause import conflicts. The `py` launcher uses the official Windows Python installation instead.
